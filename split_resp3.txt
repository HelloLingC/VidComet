I mean this, this, this, this, this, and this
are also recognizable as 3s,
even though the specific values of each pixel
is very different from one image to the next.It's sloppily written and rendered
at an extremely low resolution of 28x28 pixels,
but your brain has no trouble
recognizing it as a 3.And I want you to take a moment
to appreciate how crazy it is
that brains can do this effortlessly.The particular light-sensitive cells in your eye
that are firing when you see these three
are very different from the ones firing
when you see three.But something in that crazy smart visual cortex of yours
resolves these as representing the same idea
while at the same time recognizing the same idea
while recognizing other images as their own distinct idea.But if I told you, hey, sit down
and write for me a program
that takes in a grid of 28x28 pixels like this,
and outputs a single number between 0 and 10,
telling you what it thinks the digit is?
